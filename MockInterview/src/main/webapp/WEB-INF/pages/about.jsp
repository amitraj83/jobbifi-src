			<p>Whom is it useful for?</p> 
			<p>
			We have two kinds of audiences: (1) Job seeking candidates (job seekers), (2) Experienced professionals/Recruiters (advisors). Jobbifi is suitable for job seekers because they can search a suitable advisor who can train the candidate for their upcoming interivew and also do career consultations. Jobbifi search gives an experienced professionals/Recruiters list who can guide/train the candidate for their upcoming job. The communication is substantially open/quick/easy, but at the same time we main individual privacy as well. Jobbifi is a suitable place for advisors because (1) they can find a suitable candidate for a job in their company, (2) advisors can give back to community in terms of training candidates for job interviews. Very soon, Jobbifi brings a paid mock interview service through which advisors can get paid for their consultations as well.

			<p>How are we solving this problem?</p>
			<p>
			The problem is that no existing mechanism exist where job seeking candidates can find an experienced professional for a particular job or job interview. Our website allows candidates to find such professional and to interact with them. We have developed jobbifi.com where any individual can register as a candidate or as a professional/Recruiters. Registered candidates are allowed to search jobs linked with a list of potential professionals/Recruiters whom a candidate can contact to ask for professional help regarding a job(s). We add them on our communication server as each other friends and allow them to interact through our website. Professionals/Recruiters provide a paid consultation to the candidates and sometime they forward candidate's CV to some HRs and other companies.
