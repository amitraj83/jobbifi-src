			<p>Is there a problem? - YES</p>
			<p>
			A job seeking candidate faces several challenges to prepare for an interview.

			<p>Whom is it useful for?</p> 
			<p>
			We have two kinds of audiences: (1) Job seeking candidates, (2) Experienced professionals/Recruiters. Jobbifi is suitable for job seeking candidates because they can search jobs on our website where, for each job, jobbifi gives a related experienced professionals/Recruiter list who can guide the candidate for that job. The communication is substantially open/quick/easy, but at the same time we main individual privacy as well. Experienced professionals/Recruiters want it because (1) they search a candidate for a job in their company, (2) those who wants to give back to community in terms of training candidates for job interviews can do so here as well as they get paid for their consultation.

			<p>How are we solving this problem?</p>
			<p>
			The problem is that no existing mechanism exist where job seeking candidates can find an experienced professional for a particular job or job interview. Our website allows candidates to find such professional and to interact with them. We have developed jobbifi.com where any individual can register as a candidate or as a professional/Recruiters. Registered candidates are allowed to search jobs linked with a list of potential professionals/Recruiters whom a candidate can contact to ask for professional help regarding a job(s). We add them on our communication server as each other friends and allow them to interact through our website. Professionals/Recruiters provide a paid consultation to the candidates and sometime they forward candidate's CV to some HRs and other companies.
